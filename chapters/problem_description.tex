\chapter{Problem Description}
Consider a thin film of Silicon with height $H$ and length $L$. All the loadings and geometry are independent of the third direction; hence, the problem is formulated using the plane strain assumption. There is an existing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on top of the Silicon film with a height of $H_{\rm{SEI}}$. The origin is placed at the middle of the bottom face of the Silicon film, as shown in figure \ref{fig:probDesc}. The Si thin film's bottom face is considered rigidly fixed to a metallic substrate. The left and right faces are considered to have a roller-type boundary condition for both Si and SEI. A uniform flux of Li-ions from the top surface of SEI is present.

SEI is considered completely permeable to Li-ions. So the flux directly enters the Silicon without any diffusion in the SEI. And the diffusion in Si leads to a stress field. In the literature, this is termed diffusion-induced stress (DIS). The stress field, in turn, affects the process of diffusion called stress-enhanced diffusion (SED). \\
Due to the large deformation of the Si during lithiation/delithiation, it is necessary to formulate the problem with finite deformation theory with an elastoplastic constitutive behavior. In the present study, Si is considered to exhibit a viscoplastic nature. The SEI is assumed to undergo only elastic deformation. The constitutive law for the elastic regime is isotropic and concentration-dependent for Li$_\chi$Si and constant for SEI. 
For Mechanical equilibrium, a quasi-static model is employed. This leads to a two-way coupled system of PDEs which is then solved using the finite element method in COMSOL multiphysics.
