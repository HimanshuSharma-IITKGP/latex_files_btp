   abstract = {Maintaining an electrochemically and mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is of fundamental importance to the performance of high capacity anode materials such as silicon. In this study, a novel approach is utilized to apply controlled strains to SEI films on patterned Si electrodes. Mechanical failure mechanisms of SEI are investigated with integrated in situ AFM, ex situ FIB measurements and finite element modeling. Cross-sectional images reveal that the SEI has a bilayer structure, and through-thickness cracks appear inside of the outer SEI and arrest at the outer and inner SEI interface. The absence of cracking of the inner SEI layer implies that it has a high fracture toughness, and that it is possible to create an inner SEI which exhibits excellent strain tolerance compared to the outer layer. Interfacial delamination occurs between the outer and inner SEI layers while the inner layer is still well adhered to the underlying Si. The experimental and modeling results indicate that the inner SEI layer is sufficient for passivation of the Si surface. More broadly, the present work provides important guidelines for producing inner SEI layers that can simultaneously satisfy both electrochemical and mechanical criteria for long term passivation of silicon electrode surfaces.},

   abstract = {This paper reports the development of a new stress-dependent chemical potential for solid state diffusion under multiple driving forces including mechanical stresses. The new stress-dependent chemical potential accounts for nonlinear, inelastic, and finite deformation. By using this stress-dependent chemical potential, insertion and extraction of lithium ions into a silicon particle is investigated. The distribution and evolution of diffusion-induced stress during the insertion/extraction processes are numerically calculated. Critical particle size is obtained as a function of the charging/discharging rates. It is also found that when plastic deformation occurs, the hoop stresses on the particle surface, contrary to intuition, can become positive even during the charging process, which may explain some of the recent experimental observations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {We formulate the continuum field equations and constitutive equations that govern deformation, stress, and electric current flow in a Li-ion half-cell. The model considers mass transport through the system, deformation and stress in the anode and cathode, electrostatic fields, as well as the electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. It extends existing analyses by accounting for the effects of finite strains and plastic flow in the electrodes, and by exploring in detail the role of stress in the electrochemical reactions at the electrodeelectrolyte interfaces. In particular, we find that that stress directly influences the rest potential at the interface, so that a term involving stress must be added to the Nernst equation if the stress in the solid is significant. The model is used to predict the variation of stress and electric potential in a model 1-D half-cell, consisting of a thin film of Si on a rigid substrate, a fluid electrolyte layer, and a solid Li cathode. The predicted cycles of stress and potential are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In some circumstances, elastic-plastic deformation occurs in which both components of strain are finite. Such situations fall outside the scope of classical plasticity theory which assumes either infinitesimal strains or plastic-rigid theory for large strains. The present theory modifies the kinematics to include finite elastic and plastic strain components. For situations requiring this generalization, dilatational influences are usually significant including tliermomechanical coupling. This is introduced through the consideration of two coupled thermodynamic systems: one comprising thermoelasticity at finite strain and the other the irreversible process of dissipation and absorption of plastic work. The present paper generalizes a previous theory to permit arbitrary deformation histories.},

   abstract = {In this work, we analyze the diffusion-induced deformation in a spherical Sn (tin) particle during lithiation in the framework of chemo-mechanics, taking into account finite elasto-viscoplastic deformation and solid reaction (alloying). A viscoplastic constitutive relationship, which is based on the evolution of defects similar to dislocation mechanics, is used in the analysis. The contribution of solute atoms (lithium) to the mass transport in a deforming electrode consists of two parts; one is from “mobile” solute atoms associated with diffusion and local convection, and the other is from “immobile” solute atoms associated with local solid reaction. Finite element method is used to calculate the deformation of the spherical Sn particle with traction-free condition and galvanostatic charging during lithiation. The numerical results show that the local solid reaction increases the concentration gradient of mobile atoms, leading to the increase of the radial and hoop stress components. Plastic flow can significantly reduce the magnitudes of the stresses, likely preventing the Sn electrode from mechanical degradation and improving the structural durability of lithium-ion battery.},

   abstract = {Poor cyclic performance of electrodes in lithium-ion rechargeable cell batteries is calling for efforts to develop continuum models of diffusion under very large stresses and high solute concentrations. The present work is aimed to develop such a model based on input from atomistic simulations. We consider four fundamental features of highly nonlinear behavior associated with diffusion at high solute concentrations. First, the effect of solute-induced stresses on the activation energy of solute diffusion could be important. Second, the solute concentration may be subject to an upper limit if there exists a stoichiometric maximum concentration. Third, the strong influence of the change in local chemical environment on the interaction energy between solute and host atoms could play a significant role. Fourth, we include the effect of the solute concentration on the Young's modulus of the host material. A continuum model is developed and validated based on atomistic simulations of hydrogen diffusion in nickel. The influences of each feature above are clearly discussed through parametric studies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Knowledge of the elastic properties of Li-Si alloys as a function of Li concentration is crucial in the development of reliable deformation and fracture mechanics models for Si anodes in Li-ion batteries. Here, we have studied these properties using first-principles calculations for both amorphous and crystalline phases observed during lithiation of Si anodes. In the case of crystalline alloys, we present the anisotropic elastic tensors as well as the homogenized Young's, shear, and bulk moduli and the Poisson's ratios. We find that while these moduli decrease in an approximately linear manner with increasing Li concentration leading to significant elastic softening (by about one order of magnitude) in both crystalline and amorphous systems, the Poisson's ratios remain in the range of 0.05-0.20 and 0.20-0.30 in the case of crystalline and amorphous systems, respectively. Further, for a given Li concentration, we find that the amorphous structures are elastically somewhat softer than their crystalline counterparts, the difference being more significant (about 30-40%) in Li-poor phases. Our results underscore the importance of including the concentration dependence of elastic constants in the analysis of stress and deformation fields during lithiation and de-lithiation of Si anodes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The microstresses are strictly dissipative when ψ is independent of the Burgers tensor, but when ψ depends on G the gradient microstress is partially energetic, and this, in turn, leads to a back stress and (hence) to Bauschinger-effects in the flow rule. It is further shown that dependencies of the microstresses on ∇Ėp lead to strengthening and weakening effects in the flow rule. Typical macroscopic boundary conditions are supplemented by nonstandard microscopic boundary conditions associated with flow, and, as an aid to numerical solutions, a weak (virtual power) formulation of the nonlocal flow rule is derived. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Specifically, we develop a gradient theory for finite-deformation isotropic viscoplasticity in the absence of plastic spin. The theory is based on the Kröner-Lee decomposition F = FeFp of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic parts; a system of microstresses consistent with a microforce balance; a mechanical version of the second law that includes, via microstresses, work performed during viscoplastic flow; a constitutive theory that allows:the microstresses to depend on ∇Dp, the gradient of the plastic stretching,the free energy ψ to depend on the Burgers tensor G = F pCurlFp.

   abstract = {A large quantity of small molecules may migrate into a network of long polymers, causing the network to swell, forming an aggregate known as a polymeric gel. This paper formulates a theory of the coupled mass transport and large deformation. The free energy of the gel results from two molecular processes: stretching the network and mixing the network with the small molecules. Both the small molecules and the long polymers are taken to be incompressible, a constraint that we enforce by using a Lagrange multiplier, which coincides with the osmosis pressure or the swelling stress. The gel can undergo large deformation of two modes. The first mode results from the fast process of local rearrangement of molecules, allowing the gel to change shape but not volume. The second mode results from the slow process of long-range migration of the small molecules, allowing the gel to change both shape and volume. We assume that the local rearrangement is instantaneous, and model the long-range migration by assuming that the small molecules diffuse inside the gel. The theory is illustrated with a layer of a gel constrained in its plane and subject to a weight in the normal direction. We also predict the scaling behavior of a gel under a conical indenter.},
